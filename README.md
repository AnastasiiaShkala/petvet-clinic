## About the Project

Welcome to **PetVet Clinic** - our website serves as a modern platform, utilizing React technologies and various libraries to ensure the utmost comfort for our users.

## Project Features

### Navigation Bar (Navbar)

The navigation bar offers convenient access to all sections of the site. It utilizes React Router to create dynamic navigation between pages.

### Data Filtering and Display

Efficient application of `filter()` and `map()` functions for precise content filtering and display. The data handling is optimized to provide users with accurate results based on their queries.

### Slides Using React Slick

Integration of the React Slick library to create vibrant and responsive slides. This ensures smooth navigation and visually appealing presentation of information.

### Accordion

The website features an accordion for hiding and displaying additional content sections. This provides users with the convenience of interacting to obtain additional information.

### Use of States (useState)

Dynamic updating of the user interface is achieved through the use of `useState` hooks. This ensures interactivity and responsiveness to user actions.

### References (useRef)

Efficient management of DOM elements is facilitated by `useRef` hooks. This application is instrumental for creating smooth animations and enhancing the overall visual experience.

### Props and Mobile Adaptation

Props are utilized for efficient data transfer between React components. The website design is adapted for mobile devices using media queries and responsive design principles.

### Animations (AOS)
